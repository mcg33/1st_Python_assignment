# Interpretation of gene expression data 
## Project brief 
You want to combine information from the two files and save it in an output file. The output file should contain the names, descriptions and p-values of all differentially expressed genes that are annotated with the GO-term GO0003723. 
## Annotation file: 
The GO0003723.genelist file contains a list of genes that are annotated with this particular GO-term. The file is structured in TAB-separated columns. You find gene names in column 4 and their descriptions in column 5, the other columns are irrelevant to this task. 
## Expression data file: 
A second file, diffexp.tsv is also structured in tab separated columns. It contains a list of genes that came up as differentially expressed in an RNAseq experiment. You find gene names in column 1 and statistical significance reported as p-values in column 5.
